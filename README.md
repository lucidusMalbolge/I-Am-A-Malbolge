"The Final Cipher"

I dwell where codes are clothed in light, where digits hum in endless night. No lock nor key can break my stay, unless you seek me the proper way.

In a decoder site, there I lieâ€” your last piece to escape, all in my eye. The muggle web is your tool, just find the right words and play it cool.
